MNIST is actually quite trivial with neural networks where you can easily achieve better than 97% accuracy. Fashion-MNIST is a set of 28x28 greyscale images of clothes. It's more complex than MNIST, so it's a better representation of the actual performance of your network, and a better representation of datasets you'll use in the real world.\n","\n","<img src='assets/fashion-mnist-sprite.png' width=500px>\n","\n","In this notebook, you'll build your own neural network.
